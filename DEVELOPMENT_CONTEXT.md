- **Context File**: `.serena_context.md` ✅ Created
- **TDD Configuration**: Comprehensive TDD patterns established ✅
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces ✅
- **Test Infrastructure**: Vitest + React Testing Library configured ✅

### TDD Development Environment Ready

#### Test Framework Configuration
- **Framework**: Vitest with jsdom environment
- **Coverage Thresholds**: 95% line, 90% branch, 95% function coverage
- **Test Structure**: AAA Pattern + Given-When-Then methodology
- **Test Utilities**: Comprehensive mocking and test helpers

#### Library Integration Ready
- **@developer-hub/liquid-glass**: Primary effects library
- **shadcn/ui**: Modern UI components with Radix UI
- **glasscn-ui**: Specialized glassmorphism components
- **Framer Motion**: Performance-optimized animations
- **Next.js 15**: App Router with React 19

### Development Standards Established

#### Code Quality Gates
1. **Test Coverage**: 95%+ enforced by Vitest
2. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces
3. **Performance**: Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory
5. **TDD Cycle**: Red-Green-Refactor strictly enforced

#### Component Patterns Ready
- **Liquid Glass Components**: TDD-first development patterns
- **Seasonal Theme Engine**: Automatic time/weather-based theming
- **MDX Integration**: React components in markdown content
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and optimization

### Next Steps for Development

#### Immediate Actions for Serena MCP
1. **Component Development**: Start with LiquidGlassCard component using TDD
2. **Test First**: Always write failing tests before implementation
3. **Coverage Verification**: Ensure 95%+ coverage on all new code
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate 60fps and Core Web Vitals compliance

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# TDD Development Cycle
npm run test -- --watch ComponentName.test.tsx  # Red: Write failing test
# Implement minimal code to pass test            # Green: Make test pass
npm run test:coverage                            # Refactor: Verify coverage
```

### Serena MCP Context Integration

The following context has been established for intelligent code generation:

1. **Project Understanding**: Technical blog platform with liquid glass effects
2. **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
3. **Development Methodology**: Strict TDD with 95% coverage requirements
4. **Architecture Patterns**: Atomic design, composition over inheritance
5. **Performance Standards**: 60fps animations, Core Web Vitals compliance
6. **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
7. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E, performance, and accessibility tests
